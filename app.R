# Self Service Statistics Application
# Author: Chris Boughton
# Objective: To provide scientific statistical analysis through an easy to use application. Options should be provided to 
# input the data, data types, variables and other metrics in order to correctly select the best statistical test to use. 
# This should then produce a series of graphs, tables and worded paragraphs to justify the test chosen. Eventually a SLM could
# be built underneath the application to produce summary text for scientific papers. here
